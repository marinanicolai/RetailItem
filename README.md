RetailItem Class Write a class named RetailItem that holds data about an item in a retail store. The class should have the following fields:

description. The description field references a String object that holds a brief description of the item.
units OnHand. The unitsOnHand field is an int variable that holds the number of units currently in inventory.
price. The price field is a double that holds the itemâ€™s retail price.
Write a constructor that accepts arguments for each field, appropriate mutator methods that store values in these fields, and accessor methods that return the values in these fields. Once you have written the class, write a separate program that creates three RetailItem objects and stores the following data in them:

 	Description	Units on Hand	Price
Item #1	Jacket    	12	    59.95
Item #2	Designer Jeans	40	34.95
Item #3	Shirt   	 20	       24.95
